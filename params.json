{"name":"OpenECC","body":"## Introduction\r\nOpenECC is a software package that implements ECC-based protocols for Zigbee Smart Energy 1.x and 1.2 applications. It provides an implicit certificate scheme (ECQV), a key exchange protocol (ECMQV), and a digital signature scheme (ECDSA).\r\n\r\nOpenECC is intended for Zigbee platforms based on ARM Cortex-M3 processors. The current version is implemented in C and takes into account both speed and memory optimization techniques. OpenECC supports SECG recommended 163-bit and 233-bit Koblitz curve sect163k1 and sect233k1.\r\n\r\nThe ROM footprint of OpenECC library is about 23Kbytes, which include AES, AES-CCM, AES-MMO, and supported elliptic curve protocols. The RAM footprint of OpenECC library is about 3Kbytes. The performance of OpenECC library on an ARM Cortex-M3 processor running at a frequency of 24MHz is summarized in the following table.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n    <th rowspan=\"2\">Curve Parameter</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"2\">ECQV</th>\r\n    <th rowspan=\"2\">ECMQV</th>\r\n    <th colspan=\"2\">ECDSA</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n    <th>Reception</th>\r\n    <th>Validation</td>\r\n    <th>Sign</th>\r\n    <th>Verify</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n    <td>sect163k1</td>\r\n    <td>23.62ms</td>\r\n    <td>24.76ms</td>\r\n    <td>26.32ms</td>\r\n    <td>7.82ms</td>\r\n    <td>21.36ms</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n    <td>sect233k1</td>\r\n    <td>46.37ms</td>\r\n    <td>48.52ms</td>\r\n    <td>51.57ms</td>\r\n    <td>16.75ms</td>\r\n    <td>45.62ms</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nFor questions please contact Dr. Xinxin Fan at [fan@openecc.org](mailto:fan@openecc.org).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2012 Xinxin Fan <fan@openecc.org>\r\n    All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\r\n    are met:\r\n    - Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright \r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n    - Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright   \r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in\r\n      the documentation and/or other materials provided with the\r\n    distribution.\r\n\r\n    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \r\n    \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT \r\n    LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS \r\n    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
